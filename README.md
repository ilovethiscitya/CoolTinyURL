# CoolTinyURL

This is an interesting project to shorten the longUrl and transform them into some emoji

My responsibility is:

● Designed and implemented a responsive website to shorten the long URL into tiny emoji URL using Angular.js and NodeJS.

● Effectively implemented serve side RESTful API to encode the long URL using MongoDB.

● Improved the service by deploying the Redis for cache and Nginx for reverse proxy server.
